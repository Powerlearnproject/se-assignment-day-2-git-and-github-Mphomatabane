1. Version control helps maintain project integrity by tracking changes and managing different versions of code. GitHub is a popular tool for version control.

2. Setting up a new repository involves creating a new repository, choosing a name, description, and visibility, and initializing it with a README file.

3. A well-written README should include project description, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and contribution guidelines, facilitating effective collaboration.

4. Public repositories are openly accessible, while private repositories are restricted to authorized users. Each has advantages and disadvantages.

5. Commits track changes, and branching allows for parallel development and collaboration.

6. Pull requests facilitate code review and collaboration by allowing others to review and merge changes.

7. Forking creates a copy of a repository, allowing for independent development and experimentation.

8. Issues and project boards help track bugs, manage tasks, and improve project organization, enhancing collaborative efforts.

9. Common challenges include navigating GitHub, managing conflicts, and maintaining project organization. Best practices include regular commits, clear documentation, and effective communication.
